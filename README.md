Stellar-Motion

Observed wave length of the hydrogen alpha line of the star analyzed and compared with 
actual wavelength of hydrogen absorption to determine how far the star is moving away from the earth.

This can be used to determine how far the star is moving away from the earth
Similar analysis is used to discover slight observations of planets which in turn can discover planets.
